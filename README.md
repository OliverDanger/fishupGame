# Fish-up Game 

Fish-up Game is a flash-game-inspired web game, combining the joys of fishing and dress-up games! 
You play as a fishing robot AI who is tasked with cleaning up in Fishcorp Bay, and using your omni-printer to transform the trash into treasure.

- Self expression through many character clothing options 
(emphasis on clothing choices having in universe rewards and consiquences)
- Convenient crafting system with minimal time wasted on repetitive tasks and juggling space
- Play games and explore to collect items and progress stories
